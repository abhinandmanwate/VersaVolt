This is step by step guid to build the Backend of the Cab Management App, If you follow this you can build REST backend:

 cab management application using the first approach, where MySQL is installed before Docker:

1. Set up an AWS EC2 instance:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the EC2 service.
   - Launch a new EC2 instance, selecting the appropriate instance type and configuration.

2. Install MySQL on the EC2 instance:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.
   - Install MySQL on the EC2 instance following the appropriate installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Set up the database:
   - Configure the MySQL database, including setting up the necessary credentials, creating a new database, and granting the required privileges.

4. Develop the backend API using Java and Spring Boot:
   - Set up a Java development environment on the EC2 instance.
   - Create a new Spring Boot project or clone an existing project to the EC2 instance.
   - Configure the application properties to establish a connection to the MySQL database.

5. Containerize the backend application:
   - Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project, specifying the necessary dependencies and build steps.
   - Build a Docker image of your backend application using the Dockerfile.
   - Push the Docker image to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon ECR.

6. Set up environment variables and configuration:
   - Define environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information like database credentials.
   - Ensure that the environment variables or configuration files are properly loaded by the application.

7. Deploy the Docker container on the EC2 instance:
   - Pull the Docker image onto the EC2 instance from the container registry.
   - Run the Docker container, mapping the required ports and providing the necessary environment variables or configuration files.
   - Ensure that the Docker container can connect to the MySQL database on the EC2 instance.

8. Implement API endpoints for the frontend:
   - Design and implement the required API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the backend.
   - Use Spring Boot annotations to define RESTful endpoints and handle data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.

9. Test and debug:
   - Perform thorough testing of the backend API to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
   - Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing and make necessary fixes.

10. Monitor and maintain:
    - Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the performance and behavior of the backend application.
    - Regularly monitor the application's health and address any issues that arise.
    - Keep the backend application up to date with security patches and updates.

These steps provide a revised outline for creating the backend of your cab management application using AWS EC2, MySQL, Docker, and Spring Boot. Please make adjustments based on your specific project requirements and preferences.
